"""
🚀 CDF Toolkit Bootstrap - Tier 1: Mini Bootstrap
==================================================

This script downloads the full interactive notebook from GitHub
and creates it in your Jupyter environment for inspection.

Usage:
    from cognite.client import CogniteClient
    import requests
    
    client = CogniteClient()
    exec(requests.get("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bgfast/cognite-quickstart/main/bootstrap/mini.py").text)

What it does:
    1. Verifies you're connected to CDF
    2. Downloads the full notebook from GitHub
    3. Creates toolkit_bootstrap.ipynb in your Jupyter environment
    4. Tells you to open and run the notebook

Why use this:
    - Safest option - you can inspect the notebook before running
    - Best for first-time users
    - Best for security reviews
    - Educational - see all the steps
