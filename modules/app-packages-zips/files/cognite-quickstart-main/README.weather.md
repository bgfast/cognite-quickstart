# Weather Environment Configuration

## Overview
This configuration (`config.weather.yaml`) is a **specialized environment** focused on weather data integration and live weather monitoring. It includes only the weather-related modules and is designed for weather data applications.

## Environment Details
- **Environment Name**: `weather`
- **Target**: Weather data applications
- **Modules Included**: Weather-specific modules only
- **Validation Type**: Development

## What's Included
- **Live Weather Data Module**: Real-time weather data collection
- **Weather Transformations**: Data processing and transformation
- **Weather Workflows**: Automated weather data workflows
- **Weather Data Models**: Weather-specific data structures

## Use Cases
- **Weather monitoring applications**
- **Environmental data analysis**
- **Weather-based automation**
- **Climate data research**
- **Weather dashboard development**

## Key Features
- üå§Ô∏è **Live weather data collection**
- üìä **Weather data transformations**
