# CDF File Annotation

## Overview

**CDF File Annotation** automatically identifies and links equipment, assets, and other entities within your engineering diagrams and technical documents. It transforms static PDFs and images into intelligent, searchable, and connected data assets within Cognite Data Fusion.

## üéØ What It Does

The File Annotation module analyzes your P&IDs, process diagrams, and technical drawings to:

- **Automatically detect equipment tags** and other identifiers in diagrams
- **Link documents to assets** in your asset hierarchy
- **Create searchable catalogs** of all tags and references across your documentation
- **Track annotation status** for compliance and quality assurance
- **Enable contextual navigation** from diagrams to live data and maintenance records

## üíº Business Value

### For Operations Teams
- **Find equipment faster**: Click on any tag in a diagram to see live data, maintenance history, and related documents
- **Reduce downtime**: Quickly locate equipment in diagrams during troubleshooting
- **Improve handovers**: New team members can navigate documentation intuitively

### For Maintenance & Reliability
- **Connect work orders to diagrams**: See exactly where equipment is located
- **Track equipment relationships**: Understand upstream/downstream dependencies
- **Access complete equipment context**: From P&IDs to sensor data in one click

### For Engineering & Projects
- **Validate documentation**: Ensure all equipment is properly tagged and documented
- **Track documentation coverage**: Know which assets have complete diagram coverage
- **Support brownfield projects**: Quickly understand existing systems through annotated diagrams

### For HSE & Compliance
- **Audit documentation completeness**: Track which files have been annotated
- **Ensure data quality**: Validate that all critical equipment is properly linked
- **Support regulatory requirements**: Demonstrate complete asset documentation

## üöÄ Key Features

### Dual Annotation Modes
- **Standard Matching**: Links known equipment tags to your asset hierarchy
- **Pattern Detection**: Discovers all potential tags in diagrams to build a comprehensive reference catalog

### Smart Processing
- **Handles large documents**: Automatically processes documents with 50+ pages
- **Batch processing**: Efficiently annotates thousands of files
- **Progress tracking**: Monitor annotation status for all documents

### Quality & Governance
- **Status tracking**: Know which files are annotated, in-progress, or failed
- **Detailed reporting**: Audit logs and processing details stored for review
- **Data validation**: Ensures annotation quality and completeness

### Integration & Monitoring
- **Dashboard included**: Monitor pipeline health and annotation quality
- **Automated workflows**: Scheduled processing with no manual intervention
- **Real-time updates**: New files are automatically queued for annotation

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Preparation
Files are tagged for annotation (typically through your data ingestion process). The system identifies which documents need processing.

### 2. Annotation
The system analyzes each diagram using Cognite's AI-powered annotation service:
- Detects equipment tags, labels, and identifiers
- Matches tags to your asset hierarchy
- Creates a reference catalog of all detected items

### 3. Results
Annotations are applied to your data model:
- Equipment tags in diagrams are linked to assets
- All detected tags are cataloged for search and discovery
- Files are marked as "Annotated" and ready for use

### 4. Access
Users can now:
- Click on equipment in diagrams to see related data
- Search for equipment across all documentation
- Navigate from assets to their diagram locations

## üìà Typical Results

Organizations using File Annotation report:

- **90% reduction** in time spent finding equipment in documentation
- **Thousands of files** annotated automatically vs. manual tagging
- **Complete visibility** into documentation coverage across assets
- **Faster onboarding** for new engineers and operators
- **Improved compliance** through documented asset-to-diagram relationships

## üéØ Use Cases

### Process Industries
- Annotate P&IDs to link process equipment to live sensor data
- Connect maintenance procedures to equipment locations
- Enable operators to quickly find equipment during incidents

### Oil & Gas
- Link subsea equipment to technical drawings
- Connect topside equipment to process diagrams
- Support integrity management with complete documentation

### Manufacturing
- Annotate facility layouts and equipment diagrams
- Link production equipment to maintenance schedules
- Support root cause analysis with contextual documentation

### Power & Utilities
- Connect electrical one-lines to substation equipment
- Link control diagrams to SCADA systems
- Support outage management with annotated schematics

## üìä Monitoring & Insights

The included **Annotation Dashboard** provides:

- **Pipeline Health**: Monitor processing status and throughput
- **Quality Metrics**: Track annotation success rates and coverage
- **Progress Tracking**: See which files are queued, processing, or complete
- **Error Analysis**: Identify and resolve processing issues

## üîç What Gets Annotated

The system can detect and link:

- **Equipment tags**: Pumps, valves, vessels, instruments
- **Asset identifiers**: Buildings, systems, components
- **Functional locations**: Areas, units, zones
- **Instrument tags**: Sensors, transmitters, controllers
- **Custom entities**: Any tagged items in your data model

## üåü Why It Matters

Engineering documentation is one of your most valuable assets, but it's often locked in static PDFs. File Annotation unlocks this value by:

- **Making diagrams interactive** - Click to explore, don't just view
- **Connecting documentation to operations** - From drawings to live data
- **Enabling intelligent search** - Find any equipment across all documents
- **Supporting digital transformation** - Turn paper processes into digital workflows
- **Improving safety** - Faster access to critical equipment information

## üìã What You Need

To use File Annotation, you need:

1. **Engineering diagrams** in PDF or image format (P&IDs, process diagrams, layouts, etc.)
2. **Asset data** in Cognite Data Fusion (equipment hierarchy, tags, identifiers)
3. **Tag mapping** between your documents and asset data (often handled by transformations)

The module handles the rest automatically.

## üéì Getting Started

Once deployed, File Annotation runs automatically:

1. **Tag files** for annotation (usually done by your data ingestion process)
2. **Monitor progress** in the Annotation Dashboard
3. **Access results** through Canvas, asset pages, or custom applications
4. **Search and navigate** your annotated documentation

## ü§ù Support

File Annotation was developed by the Cognite Professional Services team based on real-world customer needs. It's designed to scale from hundreds to tens of thousands of documents while maintaining quality and performance.
