## GitHub Repo Deployer - UI/Flow Requirements

This document baselines the expected behavior and structure of the Streamlit app so we can refactor to a predictable, non-flickering workflow.

### 1) Global Rules
- There is a single source of truth for the current step: `st.session_state['workflow_step']` in {1..5}.
- Step tabs are clickable navigation:
  - Clicking a completed step moves to that step.
  - Clicking the current step does nothing.
  - Future steps are disabled until prerequisites are satisfied.
- Only content for the currently selected step is rendered. No cross-step content should appear.
- State required by later steps is stored in `st.session_state` (e.g., `extracted_path`, `config_files`, `selected_config`, `selected_env`, `env_vars_loaded`).
- Use `st.rerun()` only when changing steps or after finishes of long operations (download/extract/build/deploy) to reveal the next step.

### 2) Steps
1. Step 1: Download & Environment
   - Show Environment Configuration only in Step 1.
   - Load environment variables (from uploaded file or repo path), show debug availability, but do not request manual inputs.
   - **File Upload Requirements:**
     - Accept ALL file types for environment file uploads (no file type restrictions)
     - Support .env, .txt, .config, or any text file containing environment variables
     - Parse files with KEY=VALUE format regardless of file extension
   - accept a repo url - use this as default: https://github.com/bgfast/cognite-quickstart
   - Use GitHub API to download all files in the repo (no ZIP download due to CORS issues)
   - Download repo to temporary directory (simulating SaaS behavior)
   - extract, set `st.session_state['extracted_path']`.
   - Discover `config.*.yaml` and store list in `st.session_state['config_files']`.
   - provide a download button
   - show logging information from download
   - When complete, enable Step 2.
   - future requirement - connect to a private repo 
   - future requirement - download a zip from the current cdf project

2. Step 2: Select Configuration
   - future - Render sub-tabs, one per `config.*.yaml` file; show associated README if present.
   - Selecting a config sets `st.session_state['selected_config']` and `st.session_state['selected_env']`.
   - step 3 is always enabled because no action is required on step 2. one is selected by default. the user can change it if they want but are not required to
   - Radio selection must not clear or collapse other UI elements; provide immediate visual feedback ("Selected: <file>") and a "Configuration Details" expander
   - future - No rerun on radio change; only rerun on navigation buttons
   - for v1 - only display radio choices - one for each config file.

3. Step 3: Build and Deploy
   - show the name of the selected config
   - provide a build/deploy button
   - use the Cognite SDK directly (no subprocess calls - SaaS Streamlit runs in browser)
   - Build: Create build directory, copy modules, generate metadata (same as toolkit)
   - Deploy: Use Cognite SDK to deploy resources to CDF (OAuth2 client credentials)
   - **Verbose Logging**: Show detailed build and deploy logs with:
     - Environment variables and configuration details
     - File operations and directory structure
     - Module copying and metadata generation
     - OAuth2 authentication process
     - Resource deployment simulation
   - Show build detailed log/output within this step only.
   - Show deploy detailed logs within this step only.
   - On success, advance to Step 5.

future 4. Step 4: Verify
   - Run each of the verify tests from each module.
   - Summarize results (selected config, env, versions, success status).
   - Offer "Start New Deployment" to reset state and return to Step 1.

### 3) Architecture & File Structure
- **Clean Root Directory**: Only essential files in root:
  - `main.py` - Single entry point for Streamlit app
  - `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
  - `REQUIREMENTS.md` - This documentation
- **Modular Design**:
  - `core/` - Unified business logic (shared between Streamlit and tests)
    - `toolkit_operations.py` - Single source of truth for build/deploy operations
    - `rate_limiter.py` - GitHub API rate limiting protection
    - `cache_manager.py` - Repository caching functionality
    - `state_manager.py` - Centralized state management
    - `error_handler.py` - Comprehensive error handling
  - `services/` - Streamlit-specific services
    - `ui_steps.py` - Step rendering functions
    - `env_loader.py` - Environment file handling
    - `github_service.py` - GitHub API operations
    - `toolkit_service.py` - Streamlit wrapper for toolkit operations
    - `state.py` - Session state management
  - `tests/` - Isolated test harness (not deployed)
    - `saas_simulation_test.py` - Command line test framework
    - `syntax_check.py` - Fast AST-based syntax checker for all Streamlit app Python files
    - `run_tests.py` - Test runner
    - `run.sh` - Test execution script
- **Unified Code**: Both Streamlit app and test framework use the same `core/toolkit_operations.py`
- **Single Source of Truth**: No duplicate code between Streamlit and test harness

### 4) Non-Functional
- Minimize UI flicker: prefer containers and forms; only rerun on step change or long op completion.
- Persist critical state in `st.session_state`; avoid recomputation when navigating back to earlier steps.
- use verbose debug=true during development
- UI stability: changing selections (e.g., Step 2 radio) must not wipe other content

### 5) Acceptance Criteria
- Switching steps shows no content leakage from other steps.
- Uploading environment files (any file type) and downloading/extracting repo occur only in Step 1.
- **File Upload Acceptance:**
  - File uploader accepts ALL file types without restrictions
  - Environment files with any extension (.env, .txt, .config, etc.) are accepted
  - Files are parsed correctly regardless of file extension
- Config selection UI is visible only in Step 2.
- Build logs are confined to Step 3; deploy summary to Step 3; verification to Step 3.
- Tabs at the top reliably navigate between completed steps.
- **Test Framework Acceptance:**
  - Command line test framework passes all tests
  - GitHub API download works in test environment
  - Toolkit build/deploy works with real environment variables
  - SaaS environment simulation matches actual behavior

### 6) Testing & Validation
- **Unified Test Framework**: Command line test framework uses the same `core/toolkit_operations.py` as Streamlit app
- **SaaS Environment Simulation**: Tests must simulate actual SaaS behavior (downloading to temp directories)
- **Real Environment Testing**: Tests must use real .env files from ~/envs/ directory
- **Automated Syntax Check**: `modules/admin/github-repo-deployer/streamlit-shell-tests/syntax_check.py` must pass (no syntax errors in Streamlit app)
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
  - Environment variable loading and validation
  - GitHub API connection and rate limiting
  - Repository download with caching
  - Config file discovery
  - Toolkit build with verbose logging
  - Toolkit deploy with OAuth2 authentication
- **Test Isolation**: All test files isolated in `tests/` folder (not deployed with Streamlit)
- **Success Criteria**: All tests must pass (100% success rate) before deployment to SaaS environment

### 7) Environment Variables
- Must load from ~/envs/.env.bluefield.cog-bgfast.bgfast (same as SaaS)
- Environment variables must be passed to Cognite SDK (not subprocess commands)
- Support for CDF_PROJECT, CDF_CLUSTER, IDP_CLIENT_ID, IDP_CLIENT_SECRET, etc.
- Environment validation before SDK operations
- Use OAuth2 client credentials for CDF authentication in browser environment

### 8) Error Handling & Recovery
- Comprehensive error handling for GitHub API failures
- **Rate Limiting Protection**: All GitHub API calls use rate limiting with retry logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: Automatic retry with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 5s, 10s, 30s)
- **Rate Limit Monitoring**: Real-time rate limit status display in sidebar
- Provide a "Check GitHub API Status" action in the sidebar to surface remaining/limit/reset
- Error recovery mechanisms for Cognite SDK operations
- OAuth2 authentication fallback strategies for browser environment
- Clear error messages with actionable solutions
- Debug mode for troubleshooting
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### 9) Development Process
- **Unified Code Development**: All business logic must be in `core/toolkit_operations.py`
- **No Code Duplication**: Streamlit app and test framework must use the same core functions
- **Test-Driven Development**: All changes must be tested with command line test framework
- **Iterative Testing**: No new test files - iterate on existing `tests/saas_simulation_test.py` until it works
- **Real Environment Testing**: Use real .env files for testing (not mock data)
- **Success Criteria**: Test framework must pass (100% success rate) before any deployment
- **File Structure Maintenance**: Keep root directory clean with only essential files
- **Test Isolation**: Ensure test harness files are isolated in `tests/` folder
 - **Syntax Discipline**:
   - Run `syntax_check.py` before each commit and deployment
   - `st.set_page_config()` must be the first Streamlit call in `main.py` and placed at top-level indentation
   - Avoid circular imports that can cause `StreamlitSetPageConfigMustBeFirstCommandError`
   - Maintain consistent indentation; do not mix tabs/spaces

### 10) Current Implementation Status
- **✅ Unified Code**: `core/toolkit_operations.py` provides single source of truth for build/deploy
- **✅ Clean File Structure**: Root directory contains only essential files
- **✅ Test Framework**: Comprehensive test suite with 100% success rate
- **✅ Rate Limiting**: GitHub API protection with exponential backoff
- **✅ Repository Caching**: Efficient caching to avoid redundant downloads
- **✅ Verbose Logging**: Detailed build and deploy output for transparency
- **✅ SaaS Simulation**: Test framework accurately simulates SaaS environment
- **✅ Environment Variables**: Real .env file loading and validation
- **✅ OAuth2 Authentication**: Browser-compatible authentication for CDF
- **✅ Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
 - **✅ Automated Syntax Checks**: `syntax_check.py` enforces clean syntax across app files

## 11. Unified Code Architecture (v1.79+)

### 11.1 Core Principles
- **Single Source of Truth**: All build/deploy logic centralized in `core/toolkit_operations.py`
- **Unified Approach**: Both Streamlit app and test framework use identical core functions
- **Consistent Behavior**: Same verbose logging, error handling, and output format
- **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to core operations affect both environments simultaneously

### 11.2 Architecture Requirements
- **Core Module**: `core/toolkit_operations.py` contains all build/deploy logic
- **Service Layer**: `services/toolkit_service.py` provides Streamlit interface to core functions
- **Test Framework**: `streamlit-shell-tests/saas_simulation_test.py` uses same core functions
- **No Code Duplication**: Build and deploy logic exists in only one place

### 11.3 Implementation Status
- **✅ Build Project**: Uses `core.toolkit_operations.build_project()` in both environments
- **✅ Deploy Project**: Uses `core.toolkit_operations.deploy_project()` in both environments
- **✅ Verbose Logging**: Same detailed output format with Unicode box characters
- **✅ Error Handling**: Consistent error handling and recovery across environments
- **✅ Parameter Passing**: Same function signatures and parameter validation

### 11.4 Code Verification
```python
# Test Framework Usage
from core.toolkit_operations import build_project, deploy_project
success, output, error = build_project(repo_path, env_vars, env_name=env_name, verbose=True, logger=print)
success, output, error = deploy_project(repo_path, env_vars, env_name=env_name, verbose=True, logger=print)

# Streamlit Usage  
from core.toolkit_operations import build_project, deploy_project
success, output, error = build_project(project_path, env_vars, env_name=env_name, verbose=True, logger=st.info)
success, output, error = deploy_project(project_path, env_vars, env_name=env_name, verbose=True, logger=st.info)
```

## 12. Development Guidelines & Best Practices

### 12.1 Code Development Process
- **Test First**: Always test changes with the test framework before deploying
- **Unified Development**: Make changes to `core/toolkit_operations.py` for both environments
- **No Duplication**: Never duplicate build/deploy logic in multiple files
- **Version Tracking**: Increment version number with every change
- **Import Validation**: Test all imports work correctly before deployment

### 12.2 File Structure Maintenance
- **Root Directory**: Only `main.py`, `requirements.txt`, `REQUIREMENTS.md` in root
- **Core Directory**: Contains `toolkit_operations.py` and other core functionality
- **Services Directory**: Contains Streamlit-specific service wrappers
- **Tests Directory**: Located as sibling to `streamlit/` to prevent deployment
- **Clean Deployment**: No `__pycache__`, `.pyc`, or test files in deployment

### 12.3 Error Prevention
- **Circular Imports**: Avoid circular imports by using direct function calls
- **Module Structure**: Ensure all directories have `__init__.py` files
- **Import Paths**: Use relative imports within packages, absolute imports for core modules
- **Dependency Management**: Keep dependencies minimal and well-documented

### 12.4 Testing Requirements
- **Test Framework**: Must pass 100% of tests before deployment
- **SaaS Simulation**: Test framework must accurately simulate SaaS environment
- **Environment Variables**: Use real `.env` files for testing
- **GitHub API**: Test with rate limiting protection and caching
- **Cognite SDK**: Test OAuth2 authentication and CDF connectivity

## 13. Backlog & Future Enhancements

- **New (CDF Zip)**: ZIP file download from CDF Files API → extract using `extract_zip_to_temp_dir()` → directory
- **Dual Source Support**: Users can choose between GitHub repo or CDF zip file download
- **ZIP Logic**: Enhanced `extract_zip_to_temp_dir()` function for CDF zip download feature

### 13.6 CDF Zip File Management System
- **New Module Required**: `zip-file-uploader` module for managing repository zip files in CDF
- **CDF Space**: Dedicated Cognite space `github-repo-zips` for storing repository zip files
- **Upload Script**: Automated script to download GitHub repos as zip files and upload to CDF
- **Repository Catalog**: Maintain list of supported GitHub repositories for zip file generation
- **Version Management**: Track zip file versions and update timestamps in CDF

### 13.7 Download Source Selection (Enhanced)
- **Step 1 Enhancement**: Add radio button to choose download source:
  - 🔗 **GitHub Repository**: Direct API download (current approach)
  - 📦 **CDF Zip File**: Download pre-packaged zip from CDF Files API
- **Unified Workflow**: Both sources lead to the same Step 2 (Configuration Selection)
- **Source Detection**: Automatically detect source type and use appropriate download method
- **Fallback Logic**: If CDF zip unavailable, fallback to GitHub API download

## 14. Zip File Uploader Module Requirements

### 14.1 Module Overview
- **Module Name**: `zip-file-uploader`
- **Purpose**: Download GitHub repositories as zip files and upload them to CDF for offline access
- **Location**: `modules/admin/zip-file-uploader/`
- **CDF Space**: `github-repo-zips` (dedicated space for repository zip files)

### 14.2 Repository Catalog Management
- **Catalog File**: `repository-catalog.yaml` - List of GitHub repositories to process
- **Repository Entry Format**:
  ```yaml
  repositories:
    - owner: "cognitedata"
      repo: "cognite-samples"
      branches: ["main", "develop"]
      description: "Official Cognite samples repository"
    - owner: "bgfast"
      repo: "cognite-quickstart"

  - Handle rate limiting and error recovery
  - Support incremental updates (only download if changed)
- **Naming Convention**: `{owner}-{repo}-{branch}-{timestamp}.zip`
- **Metadata Fields**: owner, repo, branch, download_date, file_size, sha, description

### 14.4 CDF Integration Requirements
- **Files API**: Use CDF Files API for zip file storage and retrieval
- **Space Management**: Create and manage `github-repo-zips` space
- **File Metadata**: Store repository information as file metadata
- **Access Control**: Ensure proper read/write permissions for the space
- **File Lifecycle**: Implement cleanup for old zip file versions

### 14.5 Streamlit Integration
- **Download Source Selection**: Add radio button in Step 1 for GitHub vs CDF zip
- **CDF File Browser**: List available zip files from CDF when CDF source selected
- **File Download**: Use CDF Files API to download selected zip file
- **Extraction**: Use existing `extract_zip_to_temp_dir()` function
- **Fallback Logic**: If CDF zip unavailable or fails, fallback to GitHub API
