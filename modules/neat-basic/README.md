# Neat Basic Data Model

This module contains a basic data model generated using the neat library.

## Purpose

The Neat Basic Data Model module provides:
- **Basic data model structure** generated with neat
- **Simple containers and views** for common data types
- **Foundation for data modeling** using neat best practices

## Structure

### Data Models
- `neat-basic.space.yaml` - Main space for the data model
- `containers/` - Container definitions (generated by neat)
- `views/` - View definitions (generated by neat)

### Data Sets
- `neat-basic-dataset.DataSet.yaml` - Dataset for data governance

## Usage

This module should be deployed after the foundation module to provide basic data modeling capabilities.

## Dependencies

- CDF project with data modeling capabilities enabled
- Foundation module (for basic setup)

## Neat Integration

The data model files in this module are generated using the neat library:
- Containers define the data structure
- Views provide the interface for data access
- Generated from neat configuration files
